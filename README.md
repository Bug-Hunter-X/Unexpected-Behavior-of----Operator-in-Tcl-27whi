This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Tcl programming: the unexpected behavior of the `==` operator when comparing numerical values. The `==` operator in Tcl performs string comparison, which can lead to incorrect results when comparing numbers stored as strings. This example highlights the issue and provides a solution using the `expr` command for reliable numerical comparison.
